## Step 1: HTTP Server Setup
Implement a basic HTTP server in your WordleServer class. You can use existing Java libraries for this (e.g., HttpServer in com.sun.net.httpserver package).
Configure the server to listen on a specific port (e.g., 8010).

## Step 2: Handle HTTP Requests
Update the ClientHandler class to handle incoming HTTP requests. Parse the request method, path, and headers.
Identify the type of request (e.g., GET, POST) and act accordingly.

## Step 3: HTTP Responses
Modify or extend the responseConstructor method to generate appropriate HTTP responses. Consider using the HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found) and headers.
Ensure that your responses are formatted according to the HTTP protocol.

## Step 4: Update WordleClient
Modify the WordleClient class to send HTTP requests to the server instead of direct socket communication. You can use the HttpURLConnection class or other libraries for this purpose.
